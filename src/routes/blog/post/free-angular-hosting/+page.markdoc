Angular remains a top choice for building scalable and dynamic web applications, offering a robust framework with powerful tooling for both client-side and server-side rendering. While deploying Angular applications can be straightforward, finding a hosting solution that combines affordability, security, and developer-centric features can be challenging.

[Indobase Sites](/products/sites) provides a seamless hosting solution tailored for modern web applications, including Angular, with built-in performance optimizations, security features, and workflow integrations. This article highlights how Indobase Sites streamlines Angular deployments, enhances development workflows, and stacks up against other hosting services.

# Why Indobase Sites is a great choice for Angular developers

## 1. Free hosting with no upfront investment

Budget constraints can be a major factor for individual developers and startups. Indobase Sites removes this hurdle by offering free hosting, allowing teams to build, test, and iterate without worrying about costs. As your project scales, Indobase provides a seamless upgrade path to accommodate growing needs.

## 2. Supports both static and dynamic rendering

Angular applications can be built as static sites or dynamically rendered apps using Angular Universal. Indobase Sites supports both approaches, ensuring fast global content delivery for static assets while enabling server-side rendering (SSR) through **Indobase Functions** for dynamic applications. This makes it an ideal solution for everything from single-page applications (SPAs) to enterprise-grade web platforms.

## 3. Performance-driven global CDN

Speed is essential for modern applications, impacting both user experience and SEO. Indobase Sites leverages a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to serve assets efficiently, reducing latency and ensuring fast load times regardless of user location.

## 4. Built-in security and DDoS protection

Security is a top priority when deploying web applications. Indobase Sites includes [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), mitigating malicious traffic to keep your site online. Additionally, it offers **custom domain support with automatic SSL encryption**, ensuring secure connections and user data protection without requiring extra configuration.

## 5. Preview deployments for seamless collaboration

Every update pushed to Indobase Sites generates a **deployment preview link**, allowing teams to review changes in a staging environment before releasing them to production. This feature simplifies collaboration and helps ensure quality assurance before updates go live.

## 6. Flexible deployment options

Indobase Sites makes it easy to deploy Angular applications with multiple methods:

- [Git-based deployments](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Push updates directly from a connected repository.
- **CLI-based deployment**: Deploy manually in seconds using the Indobase CLI:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual file uploads**: Drag and drop your build files directly in the Indobase Console.

For new users, Indobase provides **starter templates** and example projects, making it easier to get up and running quickly.

## 7. Integrated backend services for full-stack Angular applications

Many Angular applications require authentication, databases, and backend functions. Indobase Sites integrates seamlessly with **Indobase Auth**, **Indobase Databases**, and **Indobase Functions**, enabling developers to build full-stack applications without relying on third-party backend providers.
