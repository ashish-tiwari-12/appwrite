Astro has emerged as a powerful framework for building ultra-fast, content-driven websites by leveraging its hybrid rendering approach and optimized build process. While deploying Astro applications is straightforward, finding a hosting platform that balances cost, scalability, and developer-friendly features can be challenging.

[Indobase Sites](/products/sites) offers a tailored hosting solution for modern web applications, including Astro, with built-in performance, security, and collaboration enhancements. This article explores how Indobase Sites simplifies deployment, integrates with Astro's capabilities, and compares to other hosting options.

# Why Indobase Sites is an ideal fit for Astro

## 1. Free hosting with no upfront costs

For developers and small teams, keeping hosting expenses low is important. Indobase Sites provides free hosting, eliminating financial barriers while ensuring a high-performance infrastructure. This allows you to focus on building and refining your application without worrying about costs as you scale.

## 2. Optimized for static and hybrid rendering

Astro shines with its ability to generate highly optimized static sites while enabling selective hydration for dynamic elements. Indobase Sites fully supports static exports, ensuring your site benefits from fast, globally cached delivery. Additionally, **Indobase Functions** can extend Astro's capabilities by adding dynamic backend functionality where necessary.

## 3. Performance-boosting global CDN

Speed is a key factor in both user experience and SEO. Indobase Sites uses a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to efficiently cache and serve your static assets. This results in reduced latency, faster page loads, and improved site performance across all regions.

## 4. Security-first hosting with built-in DDoS protection

As websites grow, security risks increase. Indobase Sites comes with [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), ensuring your application remains online by detecting and mitigating malicious traffic. Additionally, it includes **custom domain management** with automatic SSL encryption, securing your site with minimal setup.

## 5. Preview deployments for streamlined collaboration

Indobase Sites makes team collaboration easier by generating **deployment preview links** for every update. These previews allow you to test and review changes before going live, providing a seamless workflow for developers and stakeholders to verify updates in a staging environment.

## 6. Flexible deployment options

Deploying an Astro application with Indobase Sites is straightforward, offering multiple methods to suit different workflows:

- [Git-based deployments](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Automatically push updates from your repository's main branch.
- **CLI-based deployment**: Deploy manually with a single command:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual file uploads**: Upload static files directly through the Indobase Console.

For new users, Indobase provides **starter templates** and example projects, making it easy to get started with minimal configuration.

## 7. Integrated backend services for enhanced functionality

While Astro focuses on static site generation, many projects require authentication, databases, and serverless functions. Indobase Sites seamlessly integrates with **Indobase Auth**, **Indobase Databases**, and **Indobase Functions**, eliminating the need for third-party backend services and streamlining development.
