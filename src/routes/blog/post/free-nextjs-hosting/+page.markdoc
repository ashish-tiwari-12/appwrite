Next.js is widely adopted for building modern web applications due to its ability to handle server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes efficiently. While deploying Next.js applications can be straightforward, finding a reliable and cost-effective hosting solution with built-in scalability and developer-friendly features can be challenging.

[Indobase Sites](/products/sites) provides a hosting environment tailored for modern web applications, including Next.js, with built-in features designed to optimize performance, security, and collaboration. This article explores how Indobase Sites enhances the deployment process, integrates with Next.js capabilities, and compares to other hosting solutions.

# How Indobase Sites enhances Next.js deployments

## 1. Hosting without cost barriers

Hosting costs can be a deciding factor for individual developers and startups. Indobase Sites offers free hosting, removing an initial financial barrier while maintaining a robust infrastructure. This allows developers to test, iterate, and deploy applications without worrying about upfront expenses while providing a scalable pathway for growing projects and grow as they require.

## 2. Optimized for static and server-side rendering (SSR)

Next.js supports multiple rendering strategies, including SSR and SSG. Indobase Sites accommodates both, ensuring that static sites benefit from global caching while SSR applications can dynamically generate content as needed. This flexibility enables use cases ranging from blogs and documentation sites to complex web applications requiring real-time content updates. Additionally, Indobase's **serverless functions** can be used to enhance SSR applications with dynamic capabilities.

## 3. Performance-driven global CDN

Application speed significantly impacts user experience and search engine rankings. Indobase Sites uses a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to cache and serve static assets efficiently. This setup reduces latency and improves load times, ensuring applications perform optimally regardless of the user's location.

## 4. Built-in DDoS protection and security

Security is a critical concern for web applications, especially as they scale. Indobase Sites includes built-in [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), safeguarding applications from denial-of-service attacks by automatically detecting and mitigating malicious traffic. This ensures uptime and stability without requiring additional security configurations from developers. Additionally, Indobase Sites integrates **custom domain management**, allowing users to host applications on their own domains with SSL encryption included.

## 5. Deployment previews for enhanced collaboration

Indobase Sites integrates into your development workflow by generating **deployment preview links** for every update. These previews allow you to share changes with your team before pushing to production, improving collaboration and ensuring quality control throughout the development process. This makes it easier to review and test features in staging environments before releasing them to users.

## 6. Multiple deployment options

Indobase Sites provides multiple ways to deploy your Next.js application:

- [Git integration](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Connect a Git repository to automatically deploy changes when you push to your main branch.
- **CLI deployment**: Use the Indobase CLI to deploy manually with a single command:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual deployment**: Upload your static files directly via the Indobase Console.

Additionally, Indobase provides a set of **starter templates** and example projects to help you get started when you sign up for **Indobase Cloud**, allowing developers to quickly bootstrap their applications with minimal configuration.

## 7. Integrated backend services for dynamic applications

Many Next.js applications rely on authentication, databases, and cloud functions. Indobase Sites integrates natively with Indobase's backend services, enabling seamless authentication (via Indobase Auth), database management, and function execution without requiring external third-party services. This reduces dependencies and simplifies backend configuration, making it easier to build full-stack applications.
