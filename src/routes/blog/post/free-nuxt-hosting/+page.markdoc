Nuxt.js is a powerful framework built on Vue.js that simplifies the development of modern web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API integrations. While deploying Nuxt applications can be straightforward, selecting the right hosting provider that balances cost, performance, and ease of use can be challenging.

[Indobase Sites](/products/sites) provides an optimized hosting environment tailored for modern web applications, including Nuxt, with built-in tools for security, scalability, and developer-friendly deployment workflows. This article explores how Indobase Sites simplifies Nuxt hosting, enhances performance, and compares with other solutions.

# Why Indobase Sites is the perfect hosting solution for Nuxt

## 1. Free hosting with no upfront costs

For developers and startups, hosting expenses can be a concern. Indobase Sites provides free hosting, allowing developers to test, iterate, and launch their Nuxt applications without financial barriers. As your project scales, Indobase offers seamless upgrade options to accommodate growing traffic and resources.

## 2. Supports static and server-side rendered Nuxt applications

Nuxt's flexibility allows developers to generate fully static sites or use SSR for dynamic applications. Indobase Sites supports both models:

- **Static Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time for fast, cached delivery.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Leverage **Indobase Functions** to handle server-side logic, dynamic API calls, and real-time data rendering.

This flexibility ensures that Nuxt applications of any complexity can be hosted efficiently on Indobase Sites.

## 3. Global CDN for fast performance

Performance plays a key role in user experience and SEO. Indobase Sites uses a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to cache and serve Nuxt applications efficiently. This reduces latency and ensures optimal performance for users across different locations.

## 4. Built-in security and DDoS protection

Security is a major concern when deploying web applications. Indobase Sites includes [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), safeguarding your Nuxt app from malicious traffic and potential downtime. Additionally, it offers **custom domain management with automatic SSL encryption**, ensuring secure communication between users and your application.

## 5. Preview deployments for improved collaboration

Indobase Sites generates **deployment preview links** for every update, enabling teams to review and test changes in a staging environment before pushing them to production. This workflow enhances collaboration, making it easier to validate updates before they go live.

## 6. Multiple deployment options

Deploying a Nuxt application on Indobase Sites is simple and flexible:

- [Git-based deployments](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Automatically deploy changes when you push to your repository.
- **CLI-based deployment**: Deploy manually using the Indobase CLI:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual file uploads**: Upload static files directly through the Indobase Console.

Additionally, Indobase provides **starter templates** to help developers get up and running quickly with minimal setup.

## 7. Integrated backend services for full-stack Nuxt applications

Nuxt applications often require authentication, databases, and server-side logic. Indobase Sites seamlessly integrates with **Indobase Auth**, **Indobase Databases**, and **Indobase Functions**, eliminating the need for third-party backend services and simplifying full-stack development.
