React Native for Web enables developers to build cross-platform applications using a single codebase, allowing React Native apps to run seamlessly on web browsers. While this provides a powerful way to extend mobile applications to the web, finding a hosting solution that is cost-effective, scalable, and optimized for React Native for Web can be challenging.

[Indobase Sites](/products/sites) offers a dedicated hosting platform for modern web applications, including React Native for Web, with built-in features that optimize performance, security, and developer workflows. This article explores how Indobase Sites enhances the deployment process, integrates with React Native for Web's architecture, and compares with other hosting solutions.

# Why Indobase Sites is an ideal choice for React Native for Web

## 1. Free hosting with no upfront costs

For startups and independent developers, hosting costs can be a major concern. Indobase Sites provides free hosting, eliminating financial barriers while maintaining high performance. As your project scales, Indobase allows you to upgrade seamlessly without any downtime.

## 2. Optimized for web-based React Native applications

React Native for Web brings mobile-style components and layouts to the browser. Indobase Sites ensures smooth rendering, asset optimization, and fast content delivery, making it an ideal fit for applications that rely on React Native's component-driven architecture.

## 3. Performance-enhancing global CDN

Speed is critical for both user experience and SEO rankings. Indobase Sites uses a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to cache and serve assets efficiently, reducing latency and ensuring optimal performance no matter where users are located.

## 4. Built-in security and DDoS protection

Security is a top priority for web applications. Indobase Sites includes [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), safeguarding applications from denial-of-service attacks by mitigating malicious traffic. Additionally, it provides **custom domain support with automatic SSL encryption**, ensuring a secure browsing experience for users.

## 5. Preview deployments for smoother collaboration

Every update to your site generates a **deployment preview link**, making it easy to review changes before going live. This feature streamlines development workflows, allowing developers and stakeholders to verify updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.

## 6. Flexible deployment methods

Indobase Sites provides multiple ways to deploy your React Native for Web application:

- [Git-based deployments](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Automatically deploy updates when pushing changes to your repository.
- **CLI-based deployment**: Deploy manually with a single command:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual file uploads**: Upload your compiled build files directly through the Indobase Console.

Indobase also provides **starter templates** and example projects to help developers get up and running quickly with minimal configuration.

## 7. Integrated backend services for full-stack React Native applications

Many React Native for Web applications require authentication, databases, and cloud functions. Indobase Sites seamlessly integrates with **Indobase Auth**, **Indobase Databases**, and **Indobase Functions**, eliminating the need for third-party backend providers and streamlining development.
