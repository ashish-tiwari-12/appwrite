Remix is a modern full-stack web framework designed to optimize user experience through server-side rendering (SSR), progressive enhancement, and efficient data loading. While deploying Remix applications is straightforward, finding a hosting platform that balances cost, performance, and developer-friendly features can be challenging.

[Indobase Sites](/products/sites) provides an optimized hosting solution tailored for modern web applications, including Remix, with built-in tools for security, scalability, and flexible deployment workflows. This article explores how Indobase Sites enhances Remix hosting, simplifies development, and compares to other hosting providers.

# Why Indobase Sites is a great hosting solution for Remix

## 1. Free hosting with no upfront costs

For independent developers and startups, keeping hosting expenses low is essential. Indobase Sites offers free hosting, removing financial barriers while providing a scalable infrastructure. As your application grows, Indobase ensures a smooth upgrade path to meet increasing traffic demands.

## 2. Full support for static and server-side Remix applications

Remix enables both static and server-side rendering, making it suitable for various use cases. Indobase Sites supports:

- **Static exports**: Deliver pre-rendered pages with global caching for instant load times.
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Use **Indobase Functions** to handle API requests, server-side data fetching, and real-time updates seamlessly.

This flexibility makes Indobase Sites a powerful hosting option for any Remix application.

## 3. Performance-focused global CDN

Speed plays a crucial role in user engagement and SEO rankings. Indobase Sites utilizes a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to efficiently cache and serve your Remix application, ensuring fast load times across all regions.

## 4. Built-in security and DDoS protection

Security is a priority for production applications. Indobase Sites includes [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), helping to mitigate malicious traffic and prevent downtime. Additionally, **custom domain management with automatic SSL encryption** ensures secure communication between users and your application.
